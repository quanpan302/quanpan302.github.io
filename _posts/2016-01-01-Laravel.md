## [](#header-2)Directory Structure

The Root Directory

- The `app` Directory, contains the core code of your application.
- The `bootstrap` Directory, contains the `app.php` file which bootstraps the framework, also houses a cache directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization.
- The `config` Directory, contains all of your application's configuration files.
- The `database` Directory, contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds.
- The `public` Directory, contains the index.php file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application and configures autoloading. This directory also houses your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.
- The `resources` Directory, contains your views as well as your raw, un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript. This directory also houses all of your language files.
- The `routes` Directory, contains all of the route definitions for your application.
    - The `web.php` file contains routes that the `RouteServiceProvider` places in the `web` middleware group, which provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption.
    - The `api.php` file contains routes that the `RouteServiceProvider` places in the `api` middleware group, which provides rate limiting. These routes are intended to be stateless, so requests entering the application through these routes are intended to be authenticated via tokens and will not have access to session state.
    - The `console.php` file is where you may define all of your Closure based console commands. Each Closure is bound to a command instance allowing a simple approach to interacting with each command's IO methods. Even though this file does not define HTTP routes, it defines console based entry points (routes) into your application.
    - The `channels.php` file is where you may register all of the event broadcasting channels that your application supports.
- The `storage` Directory, contains your compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.
    - The `storage/app/public` directory may be used to store user-generated files, such as profile avatars, that should be publicly accessible. You should create a symbolic link at `public/storage` which points to this directory. You may create the link using the `php artisan storage:link` command.
- The `tests` Directory, contains your automated tests. An example `PHPUnit` test is provided out of the box.
- The `vendor` Directory, contains your `Composer` dependencies.

The App Directory

The majority of your application is housed in the `app` directory. By default, this directory is namespaced under `App` and is autoloaded by Composer using the [PSR-4 autoloading standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

- The `Broadcasting` Directory, contains all of the broadcast channel classes for your application. These classes are generated using the `make:channel` command.
- The `Console` Directory, contains all of the custom Artisan commands for your application. These commands may be generated using the `make:command` command.
- The `Events` Directory, houses `event classes`. Events may be used to alert other parts of your application that a given action has occurred, providing a great deal of flexibility and decoupling, created for you by the `event:generate` and `make:event`.
- The `Exceptions` Directory, contains your application's exception handler and is also a good place to place any exceptions thrown by your application.
- The `Http` Directory, contains your controllers, middleware, and form requests. Almost all of the logic to handle requests entering your application will be placed in this directory.
- The `Jobs` Directory, houses the `queueable jobs` for your application. Jobs may be queued by your application or run synchronously within the current request lifecycle.
- The `Listeners` Directory, contains the classes that handle your events, created for you if you execute the `event:generate` or `make:listener`.
- The `Mail` Directory, contains all of your classes that represent emails sent by your application, created for you if you execute the `make:mail`.
- The `Notifications` Directory, contains all of the "transactional" notifications that are sent by your application, such as simple notifications about events that happen within your application, created for you if you execute the `make:notification`.
- The `Policies` Directory, contains the authorization policy classes for your application, created for you if you execute the `make:policy`. Policies are used to determine if a user can perform a given action against a resource.
- The `Providers` Directory, contains all of the `service providers` for your application. Service providers bootstrap your application by binding services in the service container, registering events, or performing any other tasks to prepare your application for incoming requests.
- The `Rules` Directory, contains the custom validation rule objects for your application, created for you if you execute the `make:rule`. Rules are used to encapsulate complicated validation logic in a simple object
