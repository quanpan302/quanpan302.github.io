**Extract, transform, load)** is the general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source(s) or in a different context than the source(s).

- **Extract**, extracting the data from the source system(s).
- **Transform**, a series of rules or functions are applied to the extracted data in order to prepare it for loading into the end target.
- **Load**, loads the data into the end target, which can be any data store including a simple delimited flat file or a data warehouse.

The typical real-life **ETL cycle** consists of the following execution steps:

- Cycle initiation
- Build reference data
- Extract (from sources)
- Validate
- Transform (clean, apply business rules, check for data integrity, create aggregates or disaggregates)
- Stage (load into staging tables, if used)
- Audit reports (for example, on compliance with business rules. Also, in case of failure, helps to diagnose/repair)
- Publish (to target tables)
- Archive
