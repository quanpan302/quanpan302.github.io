**[Helm](https://helm.sh)** ([Github](https://github.com/helm/helm), [Docs](https://helm.sh/docs/)) is a tool for managing Kubernetes packages called `charts`.

Helm can do the following:

- Create new charts from scratch
- Package charts into chart archive (tgz) files
- Interact with chart repositories where charts are stored
- Install and uninstall charts into an existing Kubernetes cluster
- Manage the release cycle of charts that have been installed with Helm

For Helm, there are three important concepts:

- The `chart` is a bundle of information necessary to create an instance of a Kubernetes application.
- The `config` contains configuration information that can be merged into a packaged chart to create a releasable object.
- A `release` is a running instance of a `chart`, combined with a specific `config`.
