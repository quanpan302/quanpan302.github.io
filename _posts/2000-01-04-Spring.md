The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source

## Framework
{% include icon-external-link.html href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework" %}

The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

- **Core technologies**: dependency injection, events, resources, i18n, validation, data binding, type conversion, SpEL, AOP.
- **Testing**: mock objects, TestContext framework, Spring MVC Test, WebTestClient.
- **Data Access**: transactions, DAO support, JDBC, ORM, Marshalling XML.
- **Spring MVC** and **Spring WebFlux** web frameworks.
- **Integration**: remoting, JMS, JCA, JMX, email, tasks, scheduling, cache.
- **Languages**: Kotlin, Groovy, dynamic languages.
