**[Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/)** is a JavaScript compiler. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert **ECMAScript 2015+** code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through `@babel/polyfill`)
- Source code transformations (codemods)
- And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)
