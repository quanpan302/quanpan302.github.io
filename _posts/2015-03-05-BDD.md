**[Behavior-Driven Development, BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)**, is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.

It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.

> Similar process as TDD at the level of features, based on user needs.
> Use natural languages to create examples by structuring a bridge between "world of programming" and "natural language".
> To make the examples executable: Scenarios (how the software behaves from the stand point of user).

## Principles of BDD

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software-development methodology which essentially states that for each unit of software, a software developer must:

- `define` a test set for the unit first
- `make` the tests fail
- `then` implement the unit
- `finally` verify that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed


## Behavioral specifications

BDD specifies that business analysts and developers should collaborate in this area and should specify behavior in terms of **user stories**, which are each explicitly written down in a dedicated `document`. Each User Story should, in some way, follow the following structure:

- **Title**
  - An explicit title.
- **Narrative**
  - A **_short introductory_** section with the following structure:
    - `As a`: the person or role who will benefit from the feature
    - `I want`: the feature
    - `so that`: the benefit or value of the feature
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - A **_description_** of each specific scenario of the narrative with the following structure:
    - `Given`: the initial context at the beginning of the scenario, in one or more clauses
    - `When`: the event that triggers the scenario
    - `Then`: the expected outcome, in one or more clauses
