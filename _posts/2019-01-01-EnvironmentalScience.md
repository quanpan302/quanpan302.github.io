**[Environmental science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Environmental_science)** is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates **physical**, **biological** and **information sciences** (including ecology, biology, physics, chemistry, plant science, zoology, mineralogy, oceanography, limnology, soil science, geology and physical geography, and atmospheric science) to the _study_ of the environment, and the _solution_ of environmental problems. 

Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment. Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.

> A program that focuses on the application of biological, chemical, and physical principles to the study of the physical environment and the solution of environmental problems, including subjects such as abating or controlling environmental pollution and degradation; the interaction between human society and the natural environment; and natural resources management. Includes instruction in biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, climatology, statistics, and mathematical modeling.

## [Environmental restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_restoration)

**Environmental restoration** is closely allied with (or perhaps sometimes used interchangeably with) ecological restoration or environmental remediation.

## [Restoration ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_ecology)

**Restoration ecology** is the scientific study supporting the practice of **ecological restoration**, which is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention (介入) and action.

Effective restoration requires an explicit goal or policy, preferably an unambiguous (明确的) one that is articulated, accepted, and codified. Restoration goals reflect societal choices from among competing policy priorities, but extracting such goals is typically contentious and politically challenging.
