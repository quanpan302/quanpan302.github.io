**[Environmental science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Environmental_science)** is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates **physical**, **biological** and **information sciences** (including ecology, biology, physics, chemistry, plant science, zoology, mineralogy, oceanography, limnology, soil science, geology and physical geography, and atmospheric science) to the _study_ of the environment, and the _solution_ of environmental problems. 

Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment. Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.

> A program that focuses on the application of biological, chemical, and physical principles to the study of the physical environment and the solution of environmental problems, including subjects such as abating or controlling environmental pollution and degradation; the interaction between human society and the natural environment; and natural resources management. Includes instruction in biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, climatology, statistics, and mathematical modeling.

## [Ecosystem model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_model) (Ecological Modelling)

**Ecosystem model** is an abstract, usually mathematical, representation of an ecological system (ranging in scale from an individual population, to an ecological community, or even an entire biome (生物群落)), which is studied to better understand the real system.

There are two major types of ecological models, which are generally applied to different types of problems:

1. Analytic models are typically relatively simple (often linear) systems, that can be accurately described by a set of mathematical equations whose behavior is well-known.
2. Simulation / Computational models use numerical techniques to solve problems for which analytic solutions are impractical or impossible.

## [Environmental Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_restoration)

**Environmental Restoration** is closely allied with (or perhaps sometimes used interchangeably with) ecological restoration or environmental remediation.

### Approaches

Environmental restoration involves many different approaches and technologies depending on the requirements of the situation.

- It can involve heavy equipment like cranes, graders, bulldozers, or excavators, and also hand processes like the planting of trees and other vegetation.
- It can involve high-tech processes such as those applied in the careful environmental control required in fish-hatchery procedures.
- Today, computerized regulation is often being utilized in these processes.
- Computer-based mapping has also become an important dimension of restorative work, as has computer modelling.

## [Restoration Ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_ecology)

**Restoration Ecology** is the scientific study supporting the practice of **ecological restoration**, which is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention (介入) and action.

Effective restoration requires an explicit goal or policy, preferably an unambiguous (明确的) one that is articulated, accepted, and codified. Restoration goals reflect societal choices from among competing policy priorities, but extracting such goals is typically contentious and politically challenging.

### "FOUNDATIONS OF RESTORATION ECOLOGY" by Donald A. Falk, Margaret A. Palmer, and Joy B. Zedler

The restorationist **alters**:

- The local distribution of **_light_** and **_energy_** aboveground, and **_water_** and **_chemistry_** belowground.
- Postrestoration conditions may favor plants with different **_photosynthetic pathways_**, as well as species that can tolerate **_novel microclimatic conditions_** of temperature and humidity.
- Belowground, plant tolerance for changes in **_macro- and micro nutrients_**, as well as exposure to increased concentrations of **_toxic metals_** and changes to **_soil pH_**, **_salinity_**, and **_water_**, can be critical to the outcome of restoration.
- The altered hydrological environment can influence **_plant rooting depth_**, **_root/shoot allocation_**, and the reliance on **_mycorrhizal symbioses (菌根共生)_**.
- Restoration exposes plants to a wide range of **_physiological stressors (生理应激源)_**, and outcomes will depend on the ability of species to tolerate altered environments.

#### Ecological Theory and Restoration Ecology

Ecological restoration is to move a damaged system to an ecological state that is within some acceptable limits relative to a less disturbed system.

Science-based restorations follow:

- explicitly stated goals
- a restoration design informed by eco-logical knowledge
- quantitative assessment of system responses employing pre- and postrestoration data collection
- analysis and application of results to inform subsequent efforts

Broad areas of ecological theory that are foundational to the science of restoration ecology:

1. Ecological Theory and the Restoration of Populations and Communities (Page 24)
   - Population and ecological genetics
   - Ecophysiological and functional ecology
   - Demography (人口统计学), population dynamics, metapopulation ecology
   - Community ecology
   - Evolutionary ecology
   - Fine-scale heterogeneity (异质性)
2. Restoring Ecological Function (Page 152)
   - Food webs
   - Ecological dynamics and trajectories
   - Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
   - Modeling and simulations
   - Invasive species and community invasibility (社区入侵)
3. Restoration Ecology in Context (Page 270)
   - Research design and statistical analysis
   - Macroecology (宏观生态学)
   - Paleoecology (古生态学), climate change

### "Ecological Informatics", by Michener, William K. Recknagel, Friedrich

Ecological Informatics is an emerging discipline that takes into account the data- intensive nature of ecology, the valuable information content of ecological data, and the need to communicate results and inform decisions, including those related to research, conservation and resource management.

Ecological Entities range from genomes, individual organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems to landscapes and the biosphere, and are highly complex and distinctly evolving.

2. Analysis, Synthesis and Forecasting of Ecological Data
3. Case Studies
