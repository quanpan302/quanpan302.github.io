# [](#header-1)Data Model

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model)

A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that **organizes** elements of data and **standardizes** how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. For instance, a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which, in turn, represent the color and size of the car and define its owner.

The main **aim** of data models is to support the development of information systems by providing the definition and format of data.

## [](#header-2)Three perspectives

- **Conceptual data model** : describes the semantics of a domain, being the scope of the model. This consists of entity classes, representing kinds of things of significance in the domain, and relationship assertions about associations between pairs of entity classes. A conceptual schema specifies the kinds of facts or propositions that can be expressed using the model.
- **Logical data model** : describes the semantics, as represented by a particular data manipulation technology. This consists of descriptions of tables and columns, object oriented classes, and XML tags, among other things.
- **Physical data model** : describes the physical means by which data are stored. This is concerned with partitions, CPUs, tablespaces, and the like.

## [](#header-2)Data model theory

- The structural part: a collection of data structures which are used to create databases representing the entities or objects modeled by the database.
- The integrity part: a collection of rules governing the constraints placed on these data structures to ensure structural integrity.
- The manipulation part: a collection of operators which can be applied to the data structures, to update and query the data contained in the database.
