## Ecosystem

Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as [byte code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode) in a [Java virtual machine (JVM), or Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).

- [Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) (JDK) is a Sun product aimed at Java developers.
- [Open Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK) (OpenJDK) is a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE).

The three most basic parts of the Java ecosystem are the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which are stock parts that are supplied by Java implementations.

## Compiler

Third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the JVM. Some of these are for existing languages, while others are for extensions to the Java language. These include:

- BeanShell – A lightweight scripting language for Java[25]
- Ceylon – An object-oriented, strongly statically typed programming language with an emphasis on immutability
- Clojure – A modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform
- Gosu – A general-purpose Java Virtual Machine-based programming language released under the Apache License 2.0
- Groovy – A fully Java interoperable, Java-syntax-compatible, static and dynamic language with features from Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk
- JRuby – A Ruby interpreter
- Jython – A Python interpreter
- Kotlin – An industrial programming language for JVM with full Java interoperability
- Rhino – A JavaScript interpreter
- Scala – A multi-paradigm programming language with non-Java compatible syntax designed as a "better Java"

## Syntax

### Naming conventions

The name must not contain any white spaces.
The name should not start with special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).

#### Class

- It should start with the uppercase letter.
- It should be a noun such as Color, Button, System, Thread, etc.
- Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms.

```java
public class Employee {
    // code snippet
}
```

#### Interface

- It should start with the uppercase letter.
- It should be an adjective such as Runnable, Remote, ActionListener.
- Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms.

```java
interface Printable {
    // code snippet
}
```

#### Method

- It should start with lowercase letter.
- It should be a verb such as main(), print(), println().
- If the name contains multiple words, start it with a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as actionPerformed(). 

```java
class Employee {
    // method
    void draw() {
        // code snippet
    }
}
```

#### Variable

- It should start with a lowercase letter such as id, name.
- It should not start with the special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).
- If the name contains multiple words, start it with the lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as firstName, lastName.
- Avoid using one-character variables such as x, y, z.

```java
class Employee {
    // variable
    int id;
    
    // code snippet
}
```

#### Package

- It should be a lowercase letter such as java, lang.
- If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by dots (.) such as java.util, java.lang.

#### Constant

- It should be in uppercase letters such as RED, YELLOW.
- If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by an underscore(_) such as MAX_PRIORITY.
- It may contain digits but not as the first letter.

```java
class Employee {
    // constant
    static final int MIN_AGE = 18;

    //code snippet
}
```

> **C**amel**C**ase in java naming conventions
> Java follows camel-case syntax for naming the class, interface, method, and variable.
> If the name is combined with two words, the second word will start with uppercase letter always such as actionPerformed(), firstName, ActionEvent, ActionListener, etc.

| Name                 | Description |

### OOPs

Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

- Object
- Class
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- others
  - Coupling
  - Cohesion
  - Association
  - Aggregation
  - Composition

### Abstract class vs Interface
{% include icon-external-link.html href="https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts" %}

| Abstract class | Interface |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. | Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. |
| 2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance. | Interface supports multiple inheritance. |
| 3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. | Interface has only static and final variables. |
| 4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. | Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class. |
| 5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class. | The interface keyword is used to declare interface. |
| 6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. | An interface can extend another Java interface only. |
| 7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends". | An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements". |
| 8) A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc. | Members of a Java interface are public by default. |
| 9)Example:<br>public abstract class Shape{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;public abstract void draw();<br>} | Example:<br>public interface Drawable{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;void draw();<br>} |

### Keywords

| Keyword | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| try | The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place exception code. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally. It means, we can't use try block alone. |
| catch | The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block later. |
| finally | The "finally" block is used to execute the important code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not. |
| throw | The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception. |
| throws | The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It doesn't throw an exception. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. It is always used with method signature. |


## Java JDBC

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. There are four types of JDBC drivers:

- JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver,
- Native Driver,
- Network Protocol Driver, and
- Thin Driver
