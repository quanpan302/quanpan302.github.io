**[Java](https://www.java.com/en/)** ([Github, Java EE](https://github.com/javaee){:target="_blank"}, [Github, OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk){:target="_blank"}, [Github, Topics](https://github.com/topics/java)), is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment.

Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as [byte code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode) in a [Java virtual machine (JVM), or Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).

Different platforms target different classes of device and application domains:

- [Java Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Card): A technology that allows small Java-based applications (applets) to be run securely on smart cards and similar small-memory devices.
- [Java ME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition) (Micro Edition): Specifies several different sets of libraries (known as profiles) for devices with limited storage, display, and power capacities. It is often used to develop applications for mobile devices, PDAs, TV set-top boxes, and printers.
- [Java SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Standard_Edition) (Standard Edition): For general-purpose use on desktop PCs, servers and similar devices.
- [Jakarta EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE) (Enterprise Edition): Java SE plus various APIs which are useful for multi-tier client–server enterprise applications.
- [Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) (JDK) is a Sun product aimed at Java developers.

Third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the JVM. Some of these are for existing languages, while others are for extensions to the Java language. These include:

- BeanShell – A lightweight scripting language for Java[25]
- Ceylon – An object-oriented, strongly statically typed programming language with an emphasis on immutability
- Clojure – A modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform
- Gosu – A general-purpose Java Virtual Machine-based programming language released under the Apache License 2.0
- Groovy – A fully Java interoperable, Java-syntax-compatible, static and dynamic language with features from Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk
- JRuby – A Ruby interpreter
- Jython – A Python interpreter
- Kotlin – An industrial programming language for JVM with full Java interoperability
- Rhino – A JavaScript interpreter
- Scala – A multi-paradigm programming language with non-Java compatible syntax designed as a "better Java"
