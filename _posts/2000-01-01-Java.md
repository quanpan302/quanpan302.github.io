**[Java](https://www.java.com/en/)** ([Github, Java EE](https://github.com/javaee){:target="_blank"}, [Github, OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk){:target="_blank"}, [Github, Topics](https://github.com/topics/java)), is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment.

- [Java Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Card): A technology that allows small Java-based applications (applets) to be run securely on smart cards and similar small-memory devices.
- [Java ME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition) (Micro Edition): Specifies several different sets of libraries (known as profiles) for devices with limited storage, display, and power capacities. It is often used to develop applications for mobile devices, PDAs, TV set-top boxes, and printers.
- [Java SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Standard_Edition) (Standard Edition): For general-purpose use on desktop PCs, servers and similar devices.
- [Jakarta EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE) (Enterprise Edition): Java SE plus various APIs which are useful for multi-tier client–server enterprise applications.

## The Java Ecosystem

Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as [byte code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode) in a [Java virtual machine (JVM), or Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).

- [Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) (JDK) is a Sun product aimed at Java developers.
- [Open Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK) (OpenJDK) is a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE).

The three most basic parts of the Java ecosystem are the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which are stock parts that are supplied by Java implementations.

## Compiler

Third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the JVM. Some of these are for existing languages, while others are for extensions to the Java language. These include:

- BeanShell – A lightweight scripting language for Java[25]
- Ceylon – An object-oriented, strongly statically typed programming language with an emphasis on immutability
- Clojure – A modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform
- Gosu – A general-purpose Java Virtual Machine-based programming language released under the Apache License 2.0
- Groovy – A fully Java interoperable, Java-syntax-compatible, static and dynamic language with features from Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk
- JRuby – A Ruby interpreter
- Jython – A Python interpreter
- Kotlin – An industrial programming language for JVM with full Java interoperability
- Rhino – A JavaScript interpreter
- Scala – A multi-paradigm programming language with non-Java compatible syntax designed as a "better Java"

## Syntax

| Name | Description | Link |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| package              | domain_name. (revers order, lower case) |
| import               | reuse existing code |
| class                | `class_className {}`, template |
| method               | `funcName(args) {}`, behavior |
| variable             | Type: `instance`, `static`, `local`, `parameter`, `argument` |
| public               | `public class className { public void funcName(args) {} }` |
| void                 | return empty |
| @Test                | Annotation |
| CamelCase            | **C**amel**C**ase |
| dot                  | `instName.funcName(args);` |
| colon                |  |
| object               | object-oriented programming language |
| constructor          | `new className(args);` |
| variable declaration | `className varName;` |
| object allocation    | `className varName = new className(args);` |

### Abstract class vs Interface

| Abstract class | Interface |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. | Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. |
| 2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance. | Interface supports multiple inheritance. |
| 3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. | Interface has only static and final variables. |
| 4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. | Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class. |
| 5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class. | The interface keyword is used to declare interface. |
| 6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. | An interface can extend another Java interface only. |
| 7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends". | An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements". |
| 8) A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc. | Members of a Java interface are public by default. |
| 9)Example:<br>public abstract class Shape{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;public abstract void draw();<br>} | Example:<br>public interface Drawable{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;void draw();<br>} |
