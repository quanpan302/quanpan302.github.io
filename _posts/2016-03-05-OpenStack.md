**[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)** ([Giihub](https://github.com/openstack/openstack)) is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed and provisioned through APIs with common authentication mechanisms.

OpenStack is broken up into services to allow you to plug and play components depending on your needs. The openstack map gives you an “at a glance” view of the openstack landscape to see where those services fit and how they can work together, see [Releases on Ussuri](https://releases.openstack.org/ussuri/).
