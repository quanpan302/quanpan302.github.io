**[Data Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)**  is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design). 

## Normal forms

The objectives of normalization beyond 1NF (first normal form):

- To free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies.
- To reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations, as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life span of application programs.
- To make the relational model more informative to users.
- To make the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by.
