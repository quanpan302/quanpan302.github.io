**Composer** is a tool for **dependency management** in PHP. It is **not** a package manager in the same sense as `Yum` or `Apt` are. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them on a **per-project basis**, installing them in a directory (e.g. `vendor`) inside your project. By default it does not install anything globally.
