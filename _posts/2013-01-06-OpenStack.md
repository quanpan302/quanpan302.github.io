**[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)** ([Github](https://github.com/openstack)) is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.
