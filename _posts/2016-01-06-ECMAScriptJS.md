**[ECMAScript.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)** is a general-purpose programming language, standardized by [Ecma International](http://www.ecma-international.org/) according to the document [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm). It was inspired by JavaScript and JScript and was created to help foster multiple independent implementations. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.
